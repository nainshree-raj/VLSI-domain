                                                         Interfacing of FPGA &amp; HPS on DE1-SoC.




--> TOOLS USED (SOFTWARE /HARDWARE)
• Linux,
• PuTTy software
• Quartus Prime (Use Qsys (recently rebranded as Platform Designer) to instantiate and connect HPS 
components)
• DE1-SoC (a robust hardware design platform built around the Altera System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA, which 
combines the latest dual-core Cortex-A9 embedded cores with industry-leading programmable logic for 
ultimate design flexibility)
• SDMMC card preloaded with default GSRD image
