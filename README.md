                                           Interfacing of FPGA & HPS on DE1-SoC.

--> The objective : <br>
Data is written sequentially into the FIFO and read sequentially such that the first 
data written is the first data read out and so on with the remaining sequential data.
<br>
--> TOOLS USED (SOFTWARE /HARDWARE)<br>
• Linux<br>
• PuTTy software<br>
• Quartus Prime (Use Qsys (recently rebranded as Platform Designer) to instantiate and connect HPS 
components)<br>
• DE1-SoC (a robust hardware design platform built around the Altera System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA, which 
combines the latest dual-core Cortex-A9 embedded cores with industry-leading programmable logic for 
ultimate design flexibility)<br>
• SDMMC card preloaded with default GSRD image
