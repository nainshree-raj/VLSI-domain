                                                         Interfacing of FPGA &amp; HPS on DE1-SoC.

--> The objective 
Data is written sequentially into the FIFO and read sequentially such that the first 
data written is the first data read out and so on with the remaining sequential data.

--> TOOLS USED (SOFTWARE /HARDWARE)
• Linux
• PuTTy software
• Quartus Prime (Use Qsys (recently rebranded as Platform Designer) to instantiate and connect HPS 
components)
• DE1-SoC (a robust hardware design platform built around the Altera System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA, which 
combines the latest dual-core Cortex-A9 embedded cores with industry-leading programmable logic for 
ultimate design flexibility)
• SDMMC card preloaded with default GSRD image
